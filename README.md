xf86-input-libinput - a libinput-based X driver
===============================================

The official repository for this driver is
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/driver/xf86-input-libinput/

This is an X driver based on libinput. It is a thin wrapper around libinput,
so while it does provide all features that libinput supports it does little
beyond.

***WARNING: misconfiguration of an X input driver may leave you without
usable input devices in your X session. Use with caution.***


Prerequisites
-------------

To build, you'll need the X.Org X server SDK (check your distribution for a
xorg-x11-server-devel package or similar) and libinput (check your
distribution for libinput-devel or similar).

To get libinput from source, see:
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/libinput/

To build the X server from source:
http://www.x.org/wiki/Building_the_X_Window_System/

Building
--------

To build this driver:

    autoreconf -vif
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/build
    make && make install

Note that this assumes the same prefix as used in "Building the X Window
System" above, adjust as required. If you want a system install, use a
prefix of */usr*.

Install the default configuration file:

    cp conf/99-libinput.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/

This will assign this driver to *all* devices. Use with caution.
